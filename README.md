# MuseKey: Where Music Meets Machine Intelligence

> **Turning the "unspoken" art of music into "actionable" intelligence.**

Hi, I'm Mike Chen (MuseKey). A veteran instrumental music teacher transitioning into the frontier of **AI-powered music education**.

## 🎯 The Problem I'm Obsessed With
After 8 years of teaching, I've seen most instrumental students struggle with the same "implicit" challenges:
- **Rhythm feels right, but isn't** (The gap between internal pulse and external performance)
- **Expression is heard, but not taught** (How to quantify "play with more feeling"?)
- **Practice is repetitive, not adaptive** (One-size-fits-all metronomes and scales)

Technology addresses the "what" (wrong note), but fails at the "why" and "how" (musicality).

## 💡 My Vision: The MuseKey Framework
I'm building a conceptual framework to bridge this gap:

| Musical Challenge | Traditional Teaching | **MuseKey's AI Approach** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rhythm & Groove** | "Listen and follow" | Real-time visualization of micro-timing & groove patterns |
| **Pitch & Intonation** | "Your A is flat" | Context-aware intonation analysis (just intonation vs. equal temperament) |
| **Articulation & Dynamics** | "Play it louder here" | Comparative analysis against master recordings, emotion curve mapping |
| **Practice Efficiency** | "Repeat 100 times" | AI-generated personalized etudes targeting weak spots |

## 🚀 Current Stage & Goals
- **Stage**: Concept Validation & Partner Search
- **Immediate Goal**: To connect with **AI/audio engineers, full-stack developers, and edtech product thinkers** who are passionate about revolutionizing music learning.
- **Proof of Concept**: I am creating video demos and pedagogical white papers to detail each challenge and proposed solution.

## 🤝 I'm Looking For My Co-Founders
1.  **Technical Co-Founder (AI/Audio)**: Expertise in MIR (Music Information Retrieval), real-time audio processing, and machine learning. You love music and hate that current music tech is so... mechanical.
2.  **Technical Co-Founder (Full-Stack/Product)**: Can build beautiful, interactive web/mobile experiences. You believe that learning should feel like playing a game, not doing homework.
3.  **Business/Product Co-Founder (Optional)**: Someone who can help shape the product, talk to users, and think about growth. Experience in EdTech or consumer apps is a plus.
